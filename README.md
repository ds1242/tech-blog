  ## About/Description

  This is a homemade tech blog.  This page allows users to log in,  create blog posts, edit previous posts, add comments to their posts and other posts, delete old posts.  This is all done using handlebars to load various pages through.  Express and Node.js handle the routes for each of the pages and the functionality.  Dotenv handles the server variables when working locally with Heroku hosting the live page.  This uses JAWSDB to create the database needed to handle the Models.
